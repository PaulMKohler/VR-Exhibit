Virtual Reality  in the Fashion Industry
Welcome to the VR Runway!
As part of the second term of the VR Udacity Nanodegree program, I was tasked to build an experience that showed what impact Virtual Reality technologies have on an industry or topic of interest. I chose the fashion industry, as I have seen some of the advancements in recent years and was excited to do some more research into emerging and upcoming trends. I hope my journey through this research and development inspires you to do research about VR and learn more about an industry which you are passionate about.
